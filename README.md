This repository contains an end-to-end test automation framework developed using Playwright with TypeScript to automate and validate the flight booking functionality of the BlazeDemo application.
The framework is designed by following industry standard best practices such as:
Page Object Model (POM)
Reusability using Generic Methods
DRY Principle Implementation
Dynamic Test Data Handling (No Hardcoding)
CI/CD Compatible Structure
The test scenarios dynamically select source and destination cities from dropdowns and validate the corresponding flight results without relying on any hardcoded values.
